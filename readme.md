# :airplane: Credit Rewards Converter :airplane:
This is the project repo for the JPMC Software Engineering Lite Program, consult the program instructions for more information.

I completed the JPMorgan Chase & Co - Software Engineering Lite Virtual Experience Program! ðŸ’™

During the program, I honed my skills in Java, Git, JUnit, and Unit Testing. I successfully modified an existing system by adding the RewardValue class, enabling conversion between cash and miles. Additionally, I conducted thorough unit testing to ensure accurate conversions. You can find my code on GitHub!
